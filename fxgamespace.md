About the game

Every year, lots of kids go to FXAnimation to learn how to make a videogame. The course is simple enough to finish it within a month, but they learn many real concepts, like modeling, texturing, animating and (my part) designing. In the last two weeks, I share with them a Unity project that is ready to start mounting a level for a platform/exploration game, complete with characters, props and scripts.

You can download it here: for [Windows](files/FXGameSpace2014_win.zip) and [Mac OS X](files/FXGameSpace2014_mac.zip).

In this project worked Juan Gonz√°lez (modeling), Ismael Vega (animation) and me (programming and some basic modelling).
