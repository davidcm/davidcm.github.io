It was our project for the Global Game Jam 2012. We won the 2nd local prize!

You're a brat trying to solve daily problems. Your experience helps you and makes you solve all daily problems. This experience is you affronting the same problem and failing. Probably you can use your past to solve it... Eventually our brat will grow up and become a older boy. 

Here is [the GGJ archive page of Immaturity](http://archive.globalgamejam.org/2012/immaturity).
