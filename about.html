  <h1>Me</h1>
  <p>Currently working as a teacher and videogame developer at FXAnimation Barcelona 3D School, where I tutorize all the students' videogame projects and program them using the Unity engine. Also trying to be productive with my scarce free time to progress in my own independent projects.</p>
  <p>Previously worked at EVENTLab, directed by Mel Slater, where I helped implement and execute a VR experiment with which we were able to measure presence in a virtual environment. A paper resulted from that and was published at SIGGRAPH. We used a MoCap suit, an HMD and more.</p>
  <p>Also worked at T-Systems CRV Barcelona, a team of experts in interactive VR projects for commercial purposes, using technologies such as CAVE, Powerwall and HMD. There I worked creating 3D assets, extending their propietary engine scripting features, etc.</p>
