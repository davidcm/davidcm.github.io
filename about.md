My name is David Corominas Montes and this is roughly my professional history:

2009 - Now
---

Employed as a teacher and videogame developer at [FXAnimation Barcelona 3D School](http://www.fxanimation.es), where I tutorize all the students' videogame projects and program them using the Unity engine.

I develop a plugin for Unity that brings all needed functionality to 3rd-person-perspective game projects, like player interaction, AI, camera behaviour, level interaction, etc. in a highly modular and reusable way.

I also develop some shaders and tools that help the students enhance the quality of their Unity projects.

In parallel I research how to effectively make VR cinematics in Unreal Engine, including gaze triggered sequences, realistic looking characters, etc. and gathered a bunch of theory about the subject.

2015 - 2017
---

Been consultor and Unity programmer in [Born3D](projects/born3d), a 3D mobile app (iOS and Android) for archeological visualization of Barcelona's Born old town, using a scanned 3D model, schematic town model, pseudo-AR interface, Google Maps style touch interface...

Ported the archeological site section to WebGL afterwards.

2015

Was involved in a couple of architectural visualization projects using Unity and Oculus Rift DK2 for [EmotionExperience](http://www.emotionexperience.com).

2009
---

Worked at [EVENTLab](http://www.event-lab.org/), led by {{site.melslater}}, where I helped to implement and execute a [VR experiment](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEKxyhSPiVg) with which we were able to measure presence in a virtual environment. [A paper](projects/paper-simulating-virtual-env) resulted from that and was published at SIGGRAPH. We used an optical MoCap system, an HMD and more.

2008
---

Worked at [T-Systems CRV Barcelona](http://www.crviberia.com/), a team of experts in interactive VR projects for commercial purposes, using technologies such as CAVE, Powerwall and AR. There I worked creating 3D assets, extending their engine scripting features, etc.
