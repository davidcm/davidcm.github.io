My name is David Corominas Montes.

In my professional career I...

Am currently employed as a teacher and videogame developer at [FXAnimation Barcelona 3D School](http://www.fxanimation.es), where I tutorize all the students' videogame projects and program them using the Unity engine.

Been consultor and Unity programmer in a 3D mobile app (iOS and Android) for archeological visualization of Barcelona's Born old town, using a scanned 3D model, schematic town model, pseudo-AR interface, Google Maps style touch interface...

Was involved in a couple of architectural visualization projects using Unity and Oculus Rift DK2 for [EmotionExperience](http://www.emotionexperience.com).

Worked at [EVENTLab](http://www.event-lab.org/), led by [Mel Slater](http://twitter.com/melslater), where I helped to implement and execute a [VR experiment](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEKxyhSPiVg) with which we were able to measure presence in a virtual environment. [A paper](http://publicationslist.org/data/melslater/ref-200/a92-slater.pdf) resulted from that and was published at SIGGRAPH. We used an optical MoCap system, an HMD and more.

Worked at [T-Systems CRV Barcelona](http://www.crviberia.com/), a team of experts in interactive VR projects for commercial purposes, using technologies such as CAVE, Powerwall and AR. There I worked creating 3D assets, extending their engine scripting features, etc.
