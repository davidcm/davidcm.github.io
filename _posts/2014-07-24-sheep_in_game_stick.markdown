I'm happy to anounce that today Sheep In Hell has been finally released for the [GameStick](https://gamestick.tv/) console!

[Store Link!](https://zone.gamestick.tv/game_370)

Thanks to developer relations at PlayJam, in June I received a free GameStick device to help port our game. It was an easy task, since it's Android inside and [Unity](http://www.unity3d.com) does a great job with it. I did a few optimizations, adapted controls and UI, gathered some screenshots, fulfilled some forms and done, submited for review, and approved in two days. They kindly granted the game the number one featured spot on the store along with prime placement in the newsletter. Great news for visibility! We had to wait more than one month in order to see it released and featured, but of course the wait was worth it.

The device itself is a quality product. I've tried some other similar ones and I can say GameStick is a well made console, powerful enough to run many games smoothly, especially if we consider its reduced size. The device I received is the backer edition (it was a [Kickstarter success](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/872297630/gamestick-the-most-portable-tv-games-console-ever)), probably from the ones they still have in stock. When I first turned it on, it was a bit too much of bureaucracy (register, enter pin, confirm, etc.), but those mandatory steps led me to a developer interface where I could upload and install my apk in order to test it. As I said, I had very few issues and correcting them was a breeze.

Overall it has been a cool experience and I'm grateful that PlayJam have sent me that package.
