Finally everything is set up and published in two more main platforms: FireTV and Ouya. With this release we aimed at providing an equally fun experience, but this time with a controller instead of a touch screen. The extra tasks that I had to accomplish were mainly three: add the ability to control the game (wolf and menus) with a gamepad, tweak the GUI so that it's located within the safe zone and not eaten by the TV margins, and slightly modify the initial tutorial to reflect the new control scheme.

Now you can watch that Big Butcher Sheep even Bigger!
