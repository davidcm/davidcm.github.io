title: Sheep in Hell has been published!

It's been a hard but fun path thru this development, from the idea, the first concepts and the final testings. Certainly, to be a 3-day jam project, it's taken too long to complete, but we never said we were in a hurry! And with enough time and love, this version 1.0 is a fairly polished one.

It's a survival game in its heart, what means that you don't necessarily have to reach the end to enjoy it. Just play and try to get further every time. Every new visited room will be harder, new enemies will be introduced and challenges will get trickier as you reach new floors. And don't forget the world is procedurally generated, what means that every time you play will be a different experience. We thought that this would be a key feature of the game: replayability.

That said, we hope Sheep in Hell appeals to you all!
