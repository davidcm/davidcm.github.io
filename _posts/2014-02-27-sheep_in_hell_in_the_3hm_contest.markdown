Three Headed Monkey (3HM) Awards is a contest driven by the [UPC videogames](http://upcvideogames.com) head, Jesús Alonso. As its web site states:

> It is an award aiming at helping and encouraging future videogame developers and to make them known in the international industry.

[Ángel](http://rtypex.com) had the idea of participating and, frankly, it's never a bad idea to push our work further in order to reach more people. It's a good timing too, since version 1.1 of the game is very close to its release. Stay tuned!
