After a couple of weeks of good reception in Google Play, we decided to also release [Sheep in Hell in the Amazon Appstore](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00JWUVKFI). It's nice that Amazon doesn't charge any fee for distributing in their market.

Also, coming soon, we will release a version of the game suitable for playing on a TV. That means, for example, Ouya and FireTV. We're working on it at this time and looks promising. Watch this space!
