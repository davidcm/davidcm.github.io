Yesterday I finally finished all the stuff needed to do a (hopefully) propper release, sending an informative press note to many specialised blogs, making a press kit [in English](http://www.david.cm/presskit/sheepinhell_en) and [in Spanish](http://www.david.cm/presskit/sheepinhell_es) full of details about us and the game, and creating a [landing page](http://www.david.cm/landing/sheepinhell) that introduces the hole thing.

Our official trailer has also been released and you can view it here:

A brief list of the new features are:

- New enemy: a big, scary and ugly butcher sheep!
- New enemy: a small but fierce red chicken!
- Progressing in the game will reveal new appearance of rooms!
- New dramatic and clearer introductory room!
- And more exciting stuff, enhancements and fixes!

And that's all for today. I hope you'll enjoy the new version!
