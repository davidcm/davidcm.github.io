Yesterday I finally finished all the stuff needed to do a (hopefully) propper release, sending an informative press note to many specialised blogs, making a press kit [in English](http://www.david.cm/presskit/sheepinhell_en) and [in Spanish](http://www.david.cm/presskit/sheepinhell_es) full of details about us and the game, and creating a [landing page](http://www.david.cm/landing/sheepinhell) that introduces the hole thing.

Our official trailer has also been released.

New Features
------------

- New enemy: a big, scary and ugly butcher sheep!
- New enemy: a small but fierce red chicken!
- Progressing in the game will reveal new appearance of rooms!
- New dramatic and clearer introductory room!
- And more exciting stuff!

Enhances
--------

- Solving a challenge no longer makes enemies disappear.
- Opening and closing doors are now animated.
- New column added for advanced rooms.
- Elevator platform integration with room and graphically richer.
- Hordes now appear from various points.
- Chicken explosions now have a wider range and don't kill other chickens.
- Bazooka sheeps now start more agressively.
- And more improver stuff.

Fixes
-----

- Sometimes two doors would open at the same time creating a true disaster.
- Ground collider was sometimes misplaced and could cause falling to infinity.
- Bazooka sheep were not incrementing shot interval properly.
- Adjusted enemies quantity to increment more gradually.
- Challenges were incrementing difficulty in a somewhat uncontrolled way.
- Wolf can't be damaged while not controllable.
- And more boring stuff...

And that's all for today. I hope you'll enjoy the new version!
