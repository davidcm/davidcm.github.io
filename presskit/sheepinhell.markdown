Description
-----------

You're a wolf and you've been bad. That's why you've been put in the deepness of a hell plagued with your most hated enemies: the sheep! But they're not normal sheep. No... They're possessed demonic sheep and won't hesitate to try to kill you!

So run! Defend yourself! Because, after all, a wolf is by nature a predator, not a prey.

Break through the dungeons, solve challenges and escape this hell... If you can!

History
-------

This game was originally planned by Ángel García and me as a doable project for a home made game jam that we did on March 25th, 2013. The goal was to, at least, try to finish it. But if we didn't, it would have been ok anyway. No pressures. My job consisted in programming: procedurally generate rooms, track challenges, create enemy behaviours, fine tune character controls... It lasted 3 days and was difficult and intensive, but in the end we had a playable thing, something that could be called a game. We were quite proud of ourselves, but the project needed some more love and adjustments.
