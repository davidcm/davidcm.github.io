Description
-----------

You're a wolf and you've been bad. That's why you've been put in the deepness of a hell plagued with your most hated enemies: the sheep! But they're not normal sheep. No... They're possessed demonic sheep and won't hesitate to try to kill you!

So run! Defend yourself! Because, after all, a wolf is by nature a predator, not a prey.

Break through the dungeons, solve challenges and escape this hell... If you can!

<a id="history"></a>
History
-------

This game was originally planned by Ángel and David as a doable project for a Homemade Game Jam that they did on March 25th, 2013. The goal was to, at least, try to finish it. But if they didn't success, it would have been ok anyway. No pressures.

Ángel's job consisted in creating every graphical asset: from concept art to 3D objects and animations, GUI, textures...

David's job consisted in programming: procedurally generate rooms, track challenges, create enemy behaviours, fine tune character controls...

The jam lasted 3 days and was difficult and intensive, but in the end they had a playable thing, something that could be called a game.

After a well-deserved rest, they retook it and started working on it in their spare time. As they approached the beta phase, they had the honor of working with Atic2a, an independent two-man music and sfx studio. They made a splendid work. Many bugs were fixed, new features were added, last-minute art was made and some playtest was done. Suddenly a Gold Master arrived, just in time for the new year. So they packed everything and distributed it.

About us
--------

Ángel studied at a 3D design school in Barcelona, where David worked as a tutor for game development. There they worked together in Ángel's final project titled Book Trip. Seeing Ángel's abilities in creating all kind of 3D stuff, and how fast he was, David wanted him to be in a production team for an internal project. During all this time, there were talks about cooperating in our own projects, out of school.

The first chance of working with complete freedom was at Global Game Jam 2012, where we (along with three more people) created a beautiful game, titled Immaturity.

After one year, we met again to celebrate a Homemade Game Jam. That was the culprit of what we're presenting now: Sheep in Hell. It was a 3 days project with a 1 year perfecting process. It was within this last process when we worked with Atic2a, a two man team specialized in videogames music and effects creation.
